<H1>The Best movies according to Francois.</H1>

<H2>My top 3 movie sagas of all time.</H2>

<HR />

<H3>Dune part 1 and 2</H3>
<P>This is a very good adaptation of on one of my favourite books.</P>

<H3>Star Wars</H3>
<P>For this I only count episode 1 through to 6, rouge 1 and the solo movie. Episode 7 started ok, 
    8 was a desaster and 9 was less terible

<H3>The Marvel saga</H3>
<P>This saga brought allot of comic book characters to life. I loved it.</P>
